# Ross AI

AI-powered contract review. Upload a PDF contract and get a plain English summary and key obligations in seconds — powered by GPT-4o.

---

## Setup

### 1. Get an OpenAI API key

1. Create an account at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Add at least **$5 in credits** (you'll spend pennies per analysis)
3. Go to **API keys** and create a new key

### 2. Add your key to the project

Copy the example env file and add your real API key:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
cp .env.example .env.local

# Windows (PowerShell)
copy .env.example .env.local
```

Then open `.env.local` and replace the placeholder with your key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...your-real-key...
```

`.env.local` must be a **file** in the project root (same folder as `package.json`), not a folder. It is in `.gitignore` and will never be committed.

**Important:** restart the dev server after creating or editing `.env.local` (`Ctrl+C`, then `npm run dev`). Next.js only loads env files on startup — you should see `Environments: .env.local` in the terminal when it worked.

### 3. Run the dev server

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How it works

1. You land on the homepage — a Harvey-inspired dark hero page.
2. Click **Analyze a Contract** to go to the analysis tool.
3. Drop or upload a PDF contract (text-based, up to 4MB).
4. Click **Analyze Contract** — the app sends your PDF to a Next.js API route.
5. The server extracts the text with **unpdf**, then sends it to GPT-4o.
6. GPT-4o streams the response back, and you see the Summary and Key Obligations appear word-by-word in real time.

For a full walkthrough (upload → extract → prompt → stream → UI), see **[How it works](/docs/how-it-works)** in the docs or `content/docs/how-it-works.mdx` in the repo.

|---|---|
| Prompt engineering | `lib/prompts.ts` |
| PDF text extraction | `lib/extractPdfText.ts` |
| End-to-end AI workflow | `content/docs/how-it-works.mdx` |
| OpenAI streaming API | `app/api/review/route.ts` |
| Server-side API calls (key stays safe) | `app/api/review/route.ts` |
| Streaming response parsing on the client | `app/analyze/page.tsx` |

## Notes

- Contracts are truncated to ~15,000 characters to keep API costs low.
- Only text-based PDFs are supported. Scanned documents (image PDFs) will not work.
- This is a proof-of-concept. **Not legal advice.**
